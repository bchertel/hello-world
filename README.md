# hello-world
My first repository...

I am an undergrad student with a propensity for coding (java/python) and knowledge in general.
It is my hope that I will be able to utilize github to work on scripts for cybersecurity team which made the Regional CCDC
as well as work on personal projects and contribute in a meaningful way to the community.

I am also looking for jobs :)

To be continued...
